The BIT Management System is a web-based application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It aims to streamline college management, class organization, and facilitate communication between students, professors, and head of department.

# Features

**Admin Dashboard:** HODs can add new students and professors, create classes and subjects, manage user accounts, and oversee system settings.

**Attendance Tracking:** Professors can easily take attendance for their classes, mark students as present or absent, and generate attendance reports.

**Performance Assessment:** Professors can assess students' performance by providing marks and feedback. Students can view their marks and track their progress over time.

**Data Visualization:** Students can visualize their performance data through interactive charts and tables, helping them understand their academic performance at a glance.
